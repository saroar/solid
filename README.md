# The Open Closed Principle
  Open for extension and close for modification
# The Liskov Substitution Principle
  Child class/subclass cant be change/ are not allow anything of parent class/ super class
  Any class should be able to be replaced by one of its subclasses without affecting its functioning.
# The Interface Segregation Principle
  The Principle of segregation of the interface indicates that it is better to have different interfaces (protocols) that are specific to each client
# The Dependency Inversion Principle
  High level classes should not depend on low level classes. Both should depend on abstractions.
  Abstractions should not depend on the details. The details should depend on the abstractions.
